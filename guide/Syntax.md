# Syntax

Storm has a very readible syntax, made more so by the fact that the word `the` can be inserted at any point and not change the execution of the program (such as in [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html))
