# Syntax

Storm has a very readible syntax, made more so by the fact that the word `the` can be inserted at any point and not change the execution of the program (such as in [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html)). However, the syntax is also relatively strict.

## Control Flow

### If statements
If statements are an integral part of any programming language, letting your code *appear* to make decisions. They are also the building block of any if-type expressions. Storm requires the `then` keyword **and** that you use brackets `{}`. See the [Comparisons](#comparisons) section for details on conditions.
#### If
##### Syntax
```
if (condition) then {
    //Statements here
}
```
##### Java Counterpart
```
if (condition) {
    //Statements here
}
```
##### Examples
This is the recommended form. Note that these use the Storm [comparisons](#comparisons), which you may not be familiar with, and the simplified [printing](#printing), which you also may not be familiar with.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then {
    println("You logged in!");
}
```

These forms work, but are discouraged.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then
{
    println("You logged in!");
}
```
```
if (password = "myPassword") then
{ println("You logged in!"); }
```

Note that if your statements are one line, you can use the recommended form or you can use the one line form below.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then { println("You logged in!"); }
```
This form should only be used with a single statement to be executed if the condition is true.
#### If-elseif
If-elseif statements are not very common, but there are use cases where they are obviously the best possible choice. Multiple chained `if-elseif-elseif`s can (and generally should) be replaced by [switch](#switch-statements) statements.

##### Java Counterpart
##### Examples
#### If-else
If-else statements are the most common variation of `if` statements. There is no simpler form of them, but watch out for a lot of nested if-else statements.

##### Java Counterpart
##### Examples
#### If-elseif-else
If-elseif-else statements are a common type of `if` statement, but if-elseif-else statements with more than one `elseif` should be replaced by [switch](#switch-statements) statements.

## Input
## Output
## Comparisons
Storm uses a single equals sign (`=`) to compare values. **USE THE SINGLE EQUALS SIGN FOR COMPARISONS.** This is not like most other programming languages, which use two equals signs (`==`) to compare. *Storm will accept `==` for comparisons, but will not accept one equals sign for [assignments](#assignments).*
### String Comparisons
## Assignments / Variable Declaration
Storm uses the colon (`:`) to show assignments. **THE SINGLE EQUALS SIGN IS FOR [COMPARISONS](#comparisons)**
## Operators
## Functions
Functions are key components to programs with many different repeating actions. You will often see declarations and callings of functions throughout code.
### Declaring a function
In java, to declare a function, you would write it like this.
```
public void someFunction() {
    //Statements here
}
```
You will see that Storms functions are very similar to java's.
```
public someFuction(): {
    //Statements here
}
```
They can range from the one above to the one below.
```
private static abstract otherFunction(int parameter1, String parameter2) -> int: {
    //Statements here
}
```
