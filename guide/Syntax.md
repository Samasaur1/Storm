# Syntax

Storm has a very readible syntax, made more so by the fact that the word `the` can be inserted at any point and not change the execution of the program (such as in [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html)). However, the syntax is also relatively strict.

## Control Flow

### If statements
If statements are an integral part of any programming language, letting your code *appear* to make decisions. Storm requires the `then` keyword **and** that you use brackets `{}`. See the [Comparisons](#comparisons) section for details on conditions.
#### If
If-only statements are very common. They are also the building block of any if-type expressions. There is no simpler way to write an `if` statement.
##### Syntax
```
if (condition) then do {
    //Statements here
}
```
##### Java Counterpart
```
if (condition) {
    //Statements here
}
```
##### Examples
This is the recommended form. Note that these use the Storm [comparisons](#comparisons), which you may not be familiar with, and the simplified [printing](#printing), which you also may not be familiar with.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do {
    println("You logged in!");
}
```

These forms work, but are discouraged.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{
    println("You logged in!");
}
```
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{ println("You logged in!"); }
```

Note that if your statements are one line, you can use the recommended form or you can use the one line form below.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do { println("You logged in!"); }
```
This form should only be used with a single statement to be executed if the condition is true.
#### If-elseif
If-elseif statements are not very common, but there are use cases where they are obviously the best possible choice. Multiple chained `if-elseif-elseif`s can (and generally should) be replaced by [switch](#switch-statements) statements.
##### Syntax
```
if (condition) then do {
    //Statements here
} otherwise if (condition) then do {
    //Other statements here
}
```
##### Java Counterpart
```
if (condition) {
    //Statements here
} else if (condition) {
    //Other statements here
}
```
##### Examples
This is the recommended form. Note that these use the Storm [comparisons](#comparisons), which you may not be familiar with, and the simplified [printing](#printing), which you also may not be familiar with.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do {
    println("You logged in!");
} otherwise if (password = "" & username = "root") then do {
    println("You created a superuser account!");
}
```

These forms work, but are discouraged.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{
    println("You logged in!");
}
otherwise if (password = "" & username = "root") then do
{
    println("You created a superuser account!");
}
```
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{ println("You logged in!"); }
otherwise if (password = "" & username = "root") then do
{ println("You created a superuser account!"); }
```
#### If-else
If-else statements are the most common variation of `if` statements. There is no simpler form of them, but watch out for a lot of nested if-else statements.
##### Syntax
```
if (condition) then do {
    //Statements here
} otherwise do {
    //Other statements here
}
```
##### Java Counterpart
```
if (condition) {
    //Statements here
} else {
    //Other statements here
}
```
##### Examples
This is the recommended form. Note that these use the Storm [comparisons](#comparisons), which you may not be familiar with, and the simplified [printing](#printing), which you also may not be familiar with.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do {
    println("You logged in!");
} otherwise do {
    println("Incorrect password");
}
```

These forms work, but are discouraged.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{
    println("You logged in!");
}
otherwise do
{
    println("Incorrect password");
}
```
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{ println("You logged in!"); }
otherwise do
{ println("Incorrect password"); }
```
#### If-elseif-else
If-elseif-else statements are a common type of `if` statement, but if-elseif-else statements with more than one `elseif` should be replaced by [switch](#switch-statements) statements.
##### Syntax
```
if (condition) then do {
    //Statements here
} otherwise if (condition) then do {
    //Other statements here
} otherwise do {
    //More statements here
}
```
##### Java Counterpart
```
if (condition) {
    //Statements here
} else if (condition) {
    //Other statements here
} else {
    //More statements here
}
```
##### Examples
This is the recommended form. Note that these use the Storm [comparisons](#comparisons), which you may not be familiar with, and the simplified [printing](#printing), which you also may not be familiar with.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do {
    println("You logged in!");
} otherwise if (password = "" & username = "root") then do {
    println("You created a superuser account!");
} otherwise do {
    println("Incorrect password");
}
```

These forms work, but are discouraged.
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{
    println("You logged in!");
}
otherwise if (password = "" & username = "root") then do
{
    println("You created a superuser account!");
}
otherwise do
{
    println("Incorrect password");
}
```
```
if (password = "myPassword") then do
{ println("You logged in!"); }
otherwise if (password = "" & username = "root") then do
{ println("You created a superuser account!"); }
otherwise do { println("Incorrect password"); }
```

## Input
## Output
## Comparisons
Storm uses a single equals sign (`=`) to compare values. **USE THE SINGLE EQUALS SIGN FOR COMPARISONS.** This is not like most other programming languages, which use two equals signs (`==`) to compare. *Storm will accept `==` for comparisons, but will not accept one equals sign for [assignments](#assignments).*
### String Comparisons
## Assignments / Variable Declaration
Storm uses the colon (`:`) to show assignments. **THE SINGLE EQUALS SIGN IS FOR [COMPARISONS](#comparisons)**
## Operators
## Functions
Functions are key components to programs with many different repeating actions. You will often see declarations and calls of functions throughout code.
### Declaring a function
In Java, to declare a basic function, you would write it like this.
```
public void someFunction() {
    //Statements here
}
```
You will see that functions in Strom are very similar to Java.
```
public someFuction(): {
    //Statements here
}
```

Functions can range in complexity from the examples above to the example below.
```
private static abstract otherFunction(int parameter1, String parameter2) -> int: {
    //Statements here
}
```
Functions follow this form:
```
[visibility] {modifiers} name(Type_of_parameter name_of_parameter, Type name) -> ReturnType: {
    //Statements here
}
```
`[visibility]` is required, `{modifiers}` are optional, and the parameters are optional. If a function returns anything, you must have a return type, otherwise omit the `-> ReturnType`. You can also say that the `ReturnType` is void if there is no returned value.
