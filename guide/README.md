# Guide to the Storm Language

Storm was designed to be an easy-to-read and easy-to-write language. Because of this, the syntax is very readable, but to know how to write it please refer to [this syntax guide](Syntax.md).

To see some example projects written in Storm, check out [this page](examples).
