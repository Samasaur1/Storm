A new, easy-to-read, easy-to-write programming language

## Benefits

* Storm is an easy to read, easy to write language
* Comes with its own IDE
* Can be written in .txt files as well as the native .storm

## Drawbacks

* No direct compilation. Storm currently compiles to Java

## To Do

* Write IDE (using JavaFX). This will be easy, as it will be a Storm-only IDE, but it'll take some time and we don't have much
